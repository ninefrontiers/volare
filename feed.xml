      <description>I'm trying a new thing today on the blog. I'm going to put out a review of Design Fiction in movies and tv. Going to try and make this a weekly part of the daily.

      <description>Some Solarpunk History:

Looks like early AI images here (honestly, DALL-E hasn't progressed much past these), possibly some of the first solarpunk generative images: https://web.archive.org/web/20160305015103/http://solarpunks.tumblr.com/

      <description>ChatGPT isn‚Äôt available in China‚Äîit‚Äôs not blocked, but OpenAI, which built the tool, hasn‚Äôt made it available there‚Äîso Guo went onto Taobao, China‚Äôs biggest ecommerce site, where hundreds of thousands of merchants offer everything from iPhone cases to foreign driver‚Äôs licenses.

ChatGPT logins have become a hot commodity on Taobao, as have foreign phone numbers‚Äîparticularly virtual ones that can receive verification codes. A simple search on the platform in early February returned more than 600 stores selling logins, with prices ranging from 1-30 RMB ($0.17-$4.28). Some stores have made thousands of sales. On Tencent‚Äôs WeChat, a thriving market for ChatGPT knockoffs has sprung up‚Äîmainly via mini programs (sub-applications on the platform) like ‚ÄúChatGPT Online.‚Äù These offer users a handful of free questions before charging for time using a chatbot. Most of these are intermediaries‚Äîthey ask ChatGPT questions for users and then send the answers back. On Baidu, China‚Äôs biggest search engine, ‚ÄúHow to use ChatGPT within China‚Äù has been consistently trending for weeks. 

The scale of the black market for access to ChatGPT‚Äîand the proliferation of copycats‚Äîshows how much latent demand there is for generative AI products in China, but also the challenges facing companies that want to develop them. The ‚Äúblack box‚Äù nature of generative AI makes it hard to predict a chatbot‚Äôs output, which could be perilous in the heavily controlled Chinese internet.
